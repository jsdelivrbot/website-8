&lt;p&gt;The NSF-funded project &lt;em&gt;Adapting and Implementing Innovative Material in Statistics (AIMS)&lt;/em&gt; developed lesson plans and activities based on innovative materials that have been produced for introductory statistics courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AIMS materials are available on Github at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zief0002/aims&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/zief0002/aims&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for substantial change in statistics instruction is built on strong synergies between content, pedagogy, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;cite&gt;David Moore&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written in 2005&amp;ndash;2006, the AIMS lesson plans and student activity guides were developed to help transform an introductory statistics course into one that is aligned with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amstat.org/education/gaise/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE)&lt;/a&gt; for teaching introductory statistics courses. The lessons, which build on implications from educational research, involve students in small and large group discussion, computer explorations, and hands-on activities. The lessons are described in full detail along with the research foundations for the lessons, in Garfield and Ben-Zvi&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781402083822&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Developing Students&amp;rsquo; Statistical Reasoning: Connecting Research and Teaching Practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;aims-amp-gaise&#34;&gt;AIMS &amp;amp; GAISE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AIMS materials have been aligned with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amstat.org/asa/education/Guidelines-for-Assessment-and-Instruction-in-Statistics-Education-Reports.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2005 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) College Report&lt;/a&gt;. Each of the six recommendations from this report is listed below along with an indication of how the AIMS materials have been aligned with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasize statistical literacy and develop statistical thinking:&lt;/strong&gt; The AIMS materials help build students’ statistical literacy by having them read their text and complete study questions, and respond to literacy oriented assessment items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use real data:&lt;/strong&gt; The AIMS materials use data gathered from students (student survey data, body data) and analyze other real data sets of interest (e.g., college admissions data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress conceptual understanding rather than mere knowledge of procedures:&lt;/strong&gt; The AIMS materials focus on the nine big ideas (data, model, distribution, center, variability, comparing groups, samples, inference, and covariation), and develop them throughout the course. Students first encounter these ideas informally, and then as they revisit them, the materials aid in moving them to more formal understanding and reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster active learning in the classroom:&lt;/strong&gt; The AIMS lesson plans suggest how teachers may guide students through activities where they are actively engaged in making and testing conjectures, working in small groups, explaining their reasoning, and learning together. The materials also incorporate versions of many innovative student activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use technology for developing conceptual understanding and analyzing data:&lt;/strong&gt; The AIMS materials use Fathom&amp;trade; for data analysis and exploration, Tinkerplots&amp;trade; to help students understand and reason about graphs, Sampling SIM to simulate data to make informal inferences, and several applets to illustrate abstract concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Three free resources can be used to assess students&amp;rsquo; statistical reasoning: The ARTIST website, the ARTIST Item Database, and the ARTIST Topic Tests and CAOS tests. These are all located at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps3.cehd.umn.edu/artist/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ARTIST website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BioSQuaRE</title>
      <link>/project/2018-02-21-biosquare/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;BioSQuaRE is an instrument, created via an HHMI grant, to assess the quantitative readiness of students planning on majoring in biology or the life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, several PIs who had received grants from HHMI to implement institution-level curriculum projects wrote a proposal to write an assessment that could be commonly used to evaluate their curricular efforts. These PIs were from the following institutions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macalester&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bryn Mawr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oberlin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;St. Olaf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lewis and Clark, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Claremont Colleges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined this project shortly thereafter as an expert in assessment development. I also brought with me two graduate students, Laura Le and Laura Ziegler, who joined the project as research assistants. (Both Lauras continued to work on the project even after they graduated and matriculated into academic jobs.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://d2ihvqrbsd9p9p.cloudfront.net/contentAsset/image/19329a63-3049-4a0a-889f-3ef2fc9d18e0/fileAsset/inode/d71404c4-d89c-4547-8232-cd236fc4fd80/filter/Resize,Jpeg/jpeg_q/85/resize_w/1080&#34; alt=&#34;Q6 Phote&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;font-size:70%;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q6 group at Keck Science Center (Claremont, CA) Feb. 2016.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Front row:&lt;/em&gt; Marion Preest, Paul Overvoorde, Laura Ziegler, Liz Stanhope, Jason Belitsky, Tabassum Haque&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back row:&lt;/em&gt; Charles Umbanhowar, Peter Brodfuehrer, Greg Davis, Laura Le, Marcelo Vinces, Andrew Zieffler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took several years to develop what is now BioSQuaRE (v.5). AFter the initial work to develop items, there were many iterations of piloting, data analysis, and assessment-revision. The current iteration of the assessment includes 29 items that cover content related to: (1) Algebra, functions, and modeling; (2) Statistics and probability; and (3) Visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we hope that results from BioSQuaRE can be used to address and evaluate curricular change in biology and life science courses. For more technical detail about the development of BioSQuaRE, see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanhope, E., Ziegler, L., Haque, T., Le, L., Vinces, M., Davis, G. K., Zieffler, A., Brodfuehrer, P., Preest, M., Belisky, J., Umbanhowar, Jr., C., &amp;amp; Overvoorde, P. J. (2017). &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29196427&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Development of a Biological Science Quantitative Reasoning Exam (BioSQuaRE).&lt;/a&gt; CBE–Life Sciences Education, 16(4), ar66. doi: 10.1187/cbe.16-10-0301&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;for-instructors&#34;&gt;For Instructors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an instructor interested in considering the use of BioSQuARE with your students, please complete this brief &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevIoHPbU3CQSX2Jal3QTbudNU1rvAfj_evNyK1TOkWNj0UZw/viewform?usp=sf_link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;online survey&lt;/a&gt;, which gathers some basic contact information (e.g., institutional type, departmental listing, class size, range of students, etc.). One of the BioSQuARE team will then follow-up with additional information and instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will provide faculty liaisons with a report that summarizes the responses of their students. Please note, these summaries will be aggregated to the course or institution level and will only be provided if the number of students completing BioSQuaRE is large enough to protect individual students&amp;rsquo; anonymity. We also show comparisons of your average course performance to the averages of all students who have completed the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CATALST Project</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Change Agents for Teaching and Learning Statistics (CATALST)&lt;/em&gt; was an NSF-funded project that developed materials for teaching a radically different introductory statistics course based on randomization and bootstrap methods to provide students a deep understanding of statistical inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials were turned into a free, online book, &lt;em&gt;Statistical Thinking: A Simulation Approach to Modeling Uncertainty&lt;/em&gt;, available at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://zief0002.github.io/statistical-thinking/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://zief0002.github.io/statistical-thinking/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data sets and PDF version of the lab manual are available at the book&amp;rsquo;s Github repository: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zief0002/statistical-thinking&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/zief0002/statistical-thinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>College in the Schools</title>
      <link>/post/2018-02-19-college-in-the-schools/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2018-02-19-college-in-the-schools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ccaps.umn.edu/college-in-the-schools&#34;&gt;College in the Schools&lt;/a&gt; is a concurrent enrollment program in which existing University of Minnesota courses are taught in high schools by high school teachers. All schools wishing to offer a CIS course go through an application process, including an interview and approval by the post-secondary academic department sponsoring the course of any high school teachers who will be teaching the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since CIS is a concurrent enrollment program, students are enrolled simultaneously in the University of Minnesota course (&lt;em&gt;EPsy 3264: Basic and Applied Statistics&lt;/em&gt;) and a course at their high school. (As such, they receive two separate grades.) This setup allows for variation between the university and high school schedules. It also allows high schools to cover additional material or devote additional time to topics as needed (e.g., to accommodate requirements of state testing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;cis-statistics&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CIS Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We implemented the CIS statistics course in the 2015–2016 academic year. Since that time, we have had 17 high schools teach a CIS statistics course. The map below shows these schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2018-02-19-college-in-the-schools_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;curriculum-pedagogy-and-assessment&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Curriculum, Pedagogy, and Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet the University of Minnesota requirements, the high school students experience the same curriculum and assessments that is used at the university. (They are also graded using the same standards as students at the university.) The course uses the &lt;a href=&#34;https://priceless-wiles-535968.netlify.com/post/catalst-project/&#34;&gt;CATALST curriculum&lt;/a&gt; which immerses students in the nuts-and-bolts of statistical inference from the first day of the course via a focus on modeling and simulation. One of the primary goals of the CATALST curriculum is the promotion of statistical thinking. This is achieved by emphasizing the “core logic of statistical inference” throughout the curriculum, rather than procedural knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying philosophy of CATALST is that students are primarily responsible for their own learning. Students meet that responsibility by reading the materials, completing the homework, and carrying out any other preparation prior to each class period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also true in the classroom, where students work with 2–3 other students through a series of structured activities and discussions. This group-work is where a majority of the student learning takes place. In the classroom, the role of the instructor is more “guide-on-the-side”: leading larger classroom discussions, posing questions, and helping students draw connections and make sense of the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinkerplots.com/&#34;&gt;TinkerPlots™ software&lt;/a&gt; during class and as a part of their at-home preparation and homework. TinkerPlots™ employs allows students to create models and simulate date using an interactive set of tools. The visual display of the simulation process helps students gain a deeper conceptual understanding of the underlying data generation process used in statistical inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the emphasis on cooperative group learning in the course, students are evaluated using both group and individual assessments. Individual-level assessments offer students an opportunity to show they have learned the material, while group assessments push students’ understanding of the course material through questions that extend the content in ways they may not have previously encountered (while at the same time offering these extensions via the relative safety of the group).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;professional-development&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Professional Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school teachers who are accepted to teach the CIS course engage in ongoing professional development (PD). Each year they are required to complete 30 hours of PD: a 3-day workshop each summer and and a 1-day workshop in both the fall and spring semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the PD, CIS teachers are also observed by University of Minnesota faculty. These observations occur at least once during the initial year that a school adopts a CIS course and at least once every three years thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;resources&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;

      <title>EPsy 3264: Basic and Applied Statistics</title>
      <link>/post/epsy-3264-basic-and-applied-statistics/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/epsy-3264-basic-and-applied-statistics/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;EPsy 3264 is a 3-credit course designed to engage students using a modeling and simulation approach to inference. This course fulfills the &lt;em&gt;Mathematical Thinking&lt;/em&gt; component of the Liberal Education requirements at the University of Minnesota. Statistics is more than just an application of mathematics or a methodology used in some other discipline. Statistics is a principled way of thinking about the world. In particular, it is a principled approach to data collection, prediction, and scientific inference. In today’s dynamic and interdisciplinary world, success in confronting new analytical issues requires both substantial knowledge of a scientific or technological area and highly flexible problem-solving strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course uses pedagogical principles that are founded in research, such as daily small group activities and discussion. Upon completion of this course, students should have an understanding of the foundational concepts of data, variation and inference, as well as an appreciation for the fundamental role that statistics plays in a host of disciplines, such as business, economics, law, and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;student-learning-philosophy&#34;&gt;Student Learning Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course is designed around the philosophy that students are central to the learning process. The lab manual, textbook, instructors, and teaching assistants are all resources that are at students&amp;rsquo; disposal to help them learn the material. In the end, however, the students themselves will have to do all of the hard work associated with actually learning that material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful students become active participants in the learning process. Coming to class, participating in the activities and discussions, reading, completing the assignments, and asking questions are essential to successful learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning anything new takes time and effort and this is especially true of learning statistics, as students are not just learning a set of methods, but rather a disciplined way of thinking about the world. Changing habits of mind will take continual practice. It will also take a great deal of patience and persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As students engage in and use the skills, concepts and ideas introduced in the material, they will come to think about data and evidence in a different way. This may lead them to make different decisions or choices. But, even if this course does not change their world overnight, they will, at the very least, be able to critically think about inferences and conclusions drawn from data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The textbook for the course is &lt;a href=&#34;https://zief0002.github.io/statistical-thinking/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Statistical Thinking: A Simulation Approach to Modeling Uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;. This is a free, online textbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zief0002/statistical-thinking/blob/master/statistical-thinking-v4.pdf?raw=true&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lab Manual&lt;/a&gt; for the course. Students will work from the Lab Manual every day in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the material presented in the lab manual requires the use of TinkerPlots&amp;trade;. This software can be downloaded (for Mac or PC; it cannot be used with Chromebooks), and a license can be purchased from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tinkerplots.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.tinkerplots.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
