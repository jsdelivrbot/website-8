      <description>Change Agents for Teaching and Learning Statistics (CATALST) This NSF-funded project developed materials for teaching a radically different introductory statistics course based on randomization and bootstrap methods to provide students a deep understanding of statistical inference.
The materials were turned into a free, online book, Statistical Thinking: A Simulation Approach to Modeling Uncertainty, available at: http://zief0002.github.io/statistical-thinking/. The data sets and PDF version of the lab manual are available at the book&amp;rsquo;s Github repository: https://github.</description>

      <description>Adapting and Implementing Innovative Material in Statistics (AIMS) This NSF-funded project developed lesson plans and activities based on innovative materials that have been produced for introductory statistics courses. These lesson plans and student activity guides were developed to help transform an introductory statistics course into one that is aligned with the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) for teaching introductory statistics courses. The lessons, which build on implications from educational research, involve students in small and large group discussion, computer explorations, and hands-on activities.</description>

      <description>College in the Schools is a concurrent enrollment program in which existing University of Minnesota courses are taught in high schools by high school teachers. All schools wishing to offer a CIS course go through an application process, including an interview and approval by the post-secondary academic department sponsoring the course of any high school teachers who will be teaching the course.
Since CIS is a concurrent enrollment program, students are enrolled simultaneously in the University of Minnesota course (EPsy 3264: Basic and Applied Statistics) and a course at their high school.</description>
