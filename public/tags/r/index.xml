      <description>It feels like this spring has been especially terrible weather-wise. We have gotten a lot of snow and it has been cold. To evaluate whether this is the case or whether I have hindsight bias, I pulled some historical weather data for the month of April from Weather Underground. These data I grabbed are available at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/Public-Stuff/master/data/april-weather.csv
library(dplyr) library(forcats) library(ggplot2) library(ggridges) library(readr) library(viridis) # Read in data april = read_csv(&amp;quot;~/Documents/github/Public-Stuff/data/april-weather.csv&amp;quot;) # Filter dates april = april %&amp;gt;% filter(date &amp;lt;= 11) I grabbed data back to 2008.</description>

      <description>In two previous posts, post 1 and post 2, I used Monte Carlo simulation to predict the winner of the 2018 Minnesota State High School Boys Hockey tournament. Now that the tournament is over, I wanted to analyze how the model did and also think about ways to improve the predictions should I want to re-run such a simulation in the future.
Accuracy of the Predictions So, how well did the simulation do in predicting the state tournament champion?</description>

      <description>In a previous post, I used Monte Carlo simulation to predict the winner of the 2018 Minnesota State High School Boys Hockey tournament. Now that the quarterfinal games have been played, I thought I would update my predictions. The process for this is to:
 Update the Elo ratings based on the quarterfinal games; Re-simulate the tournament  I simulated the Class A state tournament 10,000 times using the same process as described in my previous post.</description>
