      <description>The NSF-funded project Adapting and Implementing Innovative Material in Statistics (AIMS) developed lesson plans and activities based on innovative materials that have been produced for introductory statistics courses.
The AIMS materials are available on Github at https://github.com/zief0002/aims
 The case for substantial change in statistics instruction is built on strong synergies between content, pedagogy, and technology.
&amp;mdash;David Moore
 Initially written in 2005&amp;ndash;2006, the AIMS lesson plans and student activity guides were developed to help transform an introductory statistics course into one that is aligned with the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) for teaching introductory statistics courses.</description>
