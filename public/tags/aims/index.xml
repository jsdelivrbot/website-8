      <description>The NSF-funded project Adapting and Implementing Innovative Material in Statistics (AIMS) developed lesson plans and activities based on innovative materials that have been produced for introductory statistics courses.
The AIMS materials are available on Github at https://github.com/zief0002/aims
 The case for substantial change in statistics instruction is built on strong synergies between content, pedagogy, and technology.
&amp;mdash;David Moore
