      <description>Implementation of the EPsy 3264: Basic and Applied Statistics course in 17 high schools across Minnesota.
College in the Schools is a concurrent enrollment program in which existing University of Minnesota courses are taught in high schools by high school teachers. All schools wishing to offer a CIS course go through an application process, including an interview and approval by the post-secondary academic department sponsoring the course of any high school teachers who will be teaching the course.</description>
