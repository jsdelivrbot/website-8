      <description>The NSF-funded project Adapting and Implementing Innovative Material in Statistics (AIMS) developed lesson plans and activities based on innovative materials that have been produced for introductory statistics courses.
The AIMS materials are available on Github at https://github.com/zief0002/aims
 The case for substantial change in statistics instruction is built on strong synergies between content, pedagogy, and technology.
&amp;mdash;David Moore
 Written in 2005&amp;ndash;2006, the AIMS lesson plans and student activity guides were developed to help transform an introductory statistics course into one that is aligned with the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) for teaching introductory statistics courses.</description>

      <description>Change Agents for Teaching and Learning Statistics (CATALST) was an NSF-funded project that developed materials for teaching a radically different introductory statistics course based on randomization and bootstrap methods to provide students a deep understanding of statistical inference.
The materials were turned into a free, online book, Statistical Thinking: A Simulation Approach to Modeling Uncertainty, available at: http://zief0002.github.io/statistical-thinking/.
The data sets and PDF version of the lab manual are available at the book&amp;rsquo;s Github repository: https://github.</description>
