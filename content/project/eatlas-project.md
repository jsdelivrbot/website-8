The purpose of e-ATLAS was to develop high-quality instruments to evaluate the effectiveness of curricular reform in the teaching and learning of introductory statistics at the tertiary level. All of the instruments were designed to be administered online. 

The two main instruments developed as part of this project were the *Statistics Teaching Inventory* (STI) and *Goals and Outcomes Associated with Learning Statistics* (GOALS). An additional instrument, the *Basic Literacy in Statistics (BLIS)*, was developed by Laura Ziegler as part of her doctoral dissertation research was also a part of the e-ATLAS project.

## Statistics Teaching Inventory (STI)

The *Statistics Teaching Inventory* (STI) is an assessment that can be administered to statistics instructors in order to measure their practices and beliefs related to teaching introductory statistics. There are four forms, designed for different teaching environments: 
1. Sole instructors of a face-to-face course
2. Instructors of a course that separated into a lecture section and recitation/lab section
3. Instructors of courses that are 100% online
4. Instructors of hybrid courses (mixture of face-to-face and online)

The information gathered by the STI relates to pedagogical practices, curricular emphasis, technology use, assessment practice, beliefs about student learning, and demographic information. The instrument includes between 63 and 67 items, depending on the form.

## Goals and Outcomes Associated with Learning Statistics (GOALS)

*Goals and Outcomes Associated with Learning Statistics* (GOALS) includes 20 forced-choice items designed to assess students' statistical reasoning in the context of an introductory tertiary level statistics course. Some of the concepts assessed include ideas of samples and sampling, inference and $p$-values, levels of confidence, study design, and covariation.
