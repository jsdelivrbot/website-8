*Change Agents for Teaching and Learning Statistics* (CATALST) was an NSF-funded project that developed materials for teaching a radically different introductory statistics course based on randomization and bootstrap methods to provide students a deep understanding of statistical inference.

The materials were turned into a free, online book, *Statistical Thinking: A Simulation Approach to Modeling Uncertainty*, available at: http://zief0002.github.io/statistical-thinking/. 

The data sets and PDF version of the lab manual are available at the book's Github repository: https://github.com/zief0002/statistical-thinking.
