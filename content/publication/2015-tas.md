abstract = "When Nicola and I agreed to write a discussion for George Cobb's paper, &#8220;Mere Renovation is too Little too Late: We Need to Rethink Our Undergraduate Curriculum from the Ground Up,&#8221; we knew that one of the more difficult tasks would be to respond in under 1000 words. The first thoughts we had after reading Cobb's paper were&#8230;&#8220;we agree that the current consensus undergraduate curriculum George refers to is out-of-date and needs to be up-dated.&#8221; The second thought, almost instantaneously thereafter, was, &#8220;how will such a change happen, particularly given all of the potentially affected stakeholders?&#8221; (faculty, students, alumni, administration, client disciplines, etc.) And the third, much more cynical thought, after several minutes of discussion was, &#8220;this may be impossible.&#8221;"
